As a '[Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) application', developed with
'[Shiny modules](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/modules.html)', gets
bigger, it becomes more difficult to track the relationships and to have a
clear overview of the module hierarchy. supreme is a tool to help developers
visualize the structure of their 'Shiny applications' developed with modules.

Therefore, you are able to:

1. **Visualize** relationship of modules in *existing applications*

1. **Design** *new applications* from scratch

## Usage

### 0. The model language

<p align="center">
```{r out-diagram, echo=FALSE, out.width='90%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/strboul/supreme/master/inst/media/supreme-diagram.png")
```
</p>

<br/>

A graph consists of five main fields:

1. Module name

1. Module inputs (except the defaults *input*, *output*, *session*)

1. Module outputs

1. Module returns

1. Calling modules, which are modules called a the module

### 1. Model graph for existing applications

```{r supreme-graph-example}
library(supreme)
path <- example_app_path()
obj <- supreme(src_file(path))
graph(obj)
```

<br>

### 2. Model new applications

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
model <- paste(readLines(example_yaml()), collapse = "\n")
cat(sprintf("```yaml\n%s```\n", model))
```

There are some special rules when creating model objects with *YAML*:

+ Each entity in the model must have a *name* field.

+ The entities can have optional fields, which are defined in the
  `getOption("SUPREME_MODEL_OPTIONAL_FIELDS")`

+ The fields defined in the `getOption("SUPREME_MODEL_MULTI_VAR_FIELDS")` can
  have multiple elements. It means that these fields can be expressed as an
  array.

```{r}
model_yaml <- src_yaml(text = model)
obj <- supreme(model_yaml)
```

## Known limitations

+ All the possible limitations comes from the fact that supreme is designed to
  perform static analysis on your code.

+ Although it's possible to create a Shiny application by only providing `input`
  and `output` arguments in the server side, *supreme* will not read any Shiny
  server side component missing a `session` argument. That's reasonable decision
  because modules cannot work without `session` argument and supreme is a
  package designed to work with Shiny modules.

+ For the module returns, all return values in a module should explicitly be
  wrapped in `return()` calls.

+ *supreme* will not properly parse the source code of your application if
  server side component is created with `shinyServer()`, which is
  soft-deprecated after a very early Shiny version of `0.10`.

+ Some idiosyncratic Shiny application code may not be parsed as intended. For
  such cases, it would be great if you open an issue describing the situation
  with a reproducible example.

## Installation

You can install the released version from
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=supreme):

``` r
install.packages("supreme")
```

Or get the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/strboul/supreme):

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("strboul/supreme")
```

## Acknowledgment

+ [R Core Team](https://www.r-project.org/):
  *supreme* package is brought to life thanks to *R* allowing *abstract
  syntax trees* (AST) that is used to practice static analysis on the code.

+ [datamodelr](https://github.com/bergant/datamodelr):
  Inspiring work for creating modeling language

+ [shinypod](https://github.com/ijlyttle/shinypod):
  Interesting thoughts regarding the implementation of Shiny modules
