*supreme* is a modeling tool helping you better structure Shiny applications
developed with modules.

Therefore, you are able to:

1. **Visualize** relationship of modules in *existing applications*

1. **Design** *new applications* from scratch

## Installation

You can install the released version from
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=supreme):

``` r
install.packages("supreme")
```

Or get the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/strboul/supreme):

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("strboul/supreme")
```

## Usage

### Existing applications

For your existing application, you can use `src_file()` call that reads your
application from files.

*supreme* package comes with an example path containing a dummy Shiny application
created with modules for testing issues (in `example_app_path()`).

After the application has been read,
create a *supreme* object from the model object:

```{r}
library(supreme)
path <- example_app_path()
obj <- supreme(src_file(path))
obj
```

See the generated *supreme* object in tabular form a.k.a. `data.frame`:

```{r}
as.data.frame(obj)
```

Finally, visualize the module structure:

```{r supreme-graph-example}
graph(obj)
```

### Creating YAML model objects

Model definition with *YAML* is a handy to design a **new application** from
scratch or just design the specific parts of applications. Planning ahead with
model tool can really be beneficial before going wild on implementation.

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
model <- paste(readLines(example_yaml()), collapse = "\n")
cat(sprintf("```yaml\n%s```\n", model))
```

There are some special rules when creating model objects with *YAML*:

+ Each entity in the model must have a *name* field.

+ The entities can have optional fields, which are
  `r mmy::list_en_end(paste0("*", getOption("SUPREME_MODEL_OPTIONAL_FIELDS"), "*"))`.

+ The fields
  `r mmy::list_en_end(paste0("*", getOption("SUPREME_MODEL_MULTI_VAR_FIELDS"), "*"))`
  can have multiple elements means that these fields can contain an array in the
  YAML. The other fields can only have a single element.

+ Any other field, which is not known by the *supreme* modal object, is not
  allowed and it will throw an error.

After all, use `src_yaml()` to read modeling from the YAML file:
```{r}
model_yaml <- src_yaml(text = model)
obj <- supreme(model_yaml)
```

See the next section to understand how the [model language](#model language) works.

### The model language

A *supreme* object is consisted by *entities*. An *"entity"* denotes here that a Shiny
server component is allowed to either be a server side of a module or the main `server`
function of a Shiny application.

<br/>

```{r out-diagram, echo=FALSE, out.width='90%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("inst", "media", "supreme-diagram.png"))
```

<br/>

A graph entity consists of five main fields:

1. Module name

1. Module inputs (except the defaults *input*, *output*, *session*)

1. Module outputs

1. Module returns

1. Calling modules, which are modules called by the module

## Known limitations

+ Although it's possible to create a Shiny application by only providing `input`
  and `output` arguments in the server side, *supreme* will not read any Shiny
  server side component missing a `session` argument. That's reasonable decision
  because modules cannot work without `session` argument and supreme is a
  package designed to work with Shiny modules.

+ For the module returns, all return values in a module should explicitly be
  wrapped in `return()` call.

+ *supreme* will not properly parse the source code of your application if
  server side component is created with `shinyServer()`, which is kind of
  soft-deprecated after a very early Shiny version `0.10`.

+ Some idiosyncratic Shiny application code may not be parsed as intended. For
  such cases, it would be great if you open an issue describing the situation
  with a reproducible example.

## Acknowledgment

+ [R Core Team](https://www.r-project.org/):
  *supreme* package is brought to life thanks to *R* allowing *abstract
  syntax trees* (AST) that is used to practice static analysis on the code.

+ [datamodelr](https://github.com/bergant/datamodelr):
  Inspiring work for creating modeling language

+ [shinypod](https://github.com/ijlyttle/shinypod):
  Interesting thoughts regarding the implementation of Shiny modules
