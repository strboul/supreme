*supreme* helps you structure Shiny applications developed with modules

Therefore, you are able to:

+ **Visualize** relationship of modules in any existing application

+ **Design** new applications from scratch

## Usage

First of all, the application has to be read as a model object by *supreme*.

For your existing application, you may read it from a file by using `src_file()`. Please see the vignette for the other options to read your application as model objects.

After reading, create a *supreme* object from the read model object:

```{r}
library(supreme)
path <- example_app_path()
obj <- supreme(src_file(path))
obj
```

Visualize the module structure:

```{r supreme-graph-example}
graph(obj)
```

<br>

See the generated *supreme* object in tabular form (as `data.frame` or `tibble`):

```{r}
df <- as.data.frame(obj)
tbbl <- tibble::as_tibble(df)
tbbl
```

For designing a new application, or designing a new part in your existing
application, use YAML:

## Installation

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("strboul/supreme")
```

## Contribution

This package is still on progress. **API is subject to change.**

PRs and issues are much appreciated.

## Acknowledgements

+ R Core Team: *supreme* came to life thanks to *R* allowing to manipulate *abstract
syntax trees* (AST) easily in the code that is a huge benefit of practising static
analyses.

+ [datamodelr](https://github.com/bergant/datamodelr): Inspiring work for
  creating modelling language

+ [shinypod](https://github.com/ijlyttle/shinypod): Interesting thoughts regarding
  the implementation of Shiny modules
